                <h2>BabaCat <br>Origin<br> Story</h2>
                <h4> World's <strong> first </strong> and one and only pujari cat.</h4>
                <p>Babacat is not a normal cat. He is ambitious, adventurous, kind and most importantly, spiritual. 
                    He believes the universe has put him in his path to do something great.
                 Babacat wonders around the Himalayas, seeking truth and peace & those who meet him on the way are said to be very lucky. He has garnered a cult following all around the world. They identify themselves as "Babagang". This website honours Babacat by allowing people to be united together through original pieces of clothing, made with heavenly care. Come become a part of Babagang and set yourself apart from others. This is the Baba way of life. </p>
